I’m honored to be featured by Dartmouth’s Guarini School in a **Student Spotlight** after attending the **AAAS CASE 2025** workshop in Washington, D.C. The interview covers my background, research focus in human-centered security & privacy, motivation for policy engagement, and advice to incoming graduate students.

### Highlights

**Hometown & Identity**  
I proudly consider **Zefta** in Egypt’s Nile Delta my hometown—a place whose history, community, and culture shaped my values. The legacy of resilience (from the 1919 *Zefta Republic*) continues to inspire how I approach work, service, and impact.

**Academic Path**  
- Ranked **18th nationwide** in Egypt’s Thanawya Amma (Math) — **408/410 (99.51%)**.  
- Earned a **full scholarship** to the **German International University (GIU)** in Cairo; majored in Computer Science (Information Security).  

**Research Focus**  
I work on **human-centered cybersecurity and privacy**—designing tools and policies that are **technically robust** yet **usable**, respectful of real human needs, and mindful of context.

**Policy & AAAS CASE 2025**  
I applied to **AAAS CASE** to learn how science policy is made and how researchers can engage constructively with policymakers—especially around **privacy** and **security**. I care deeply about advocating for **international students in STEM**, whose diverse perspectives strengthen research and innovation.

**Advice to Incoming Graduate Students**  
Set the bar high—**choose a circle that does the same**. Work on things that matter, with people who care. Aim for depth, quality, and real impact.

**Life in the Upper Valley**  
Quiet snowy walks in Hanover help me reflect and recharge—reminding me of the journey from Egypt to New Hampshire and the purpose behind it.
