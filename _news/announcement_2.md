I was excited to attend the **Network and Distributed System Security Symposium (NDSS) 2025** in San Diego, California! üå¥‚òÄÔ∏è  

The week began with the **USEC 2025 workshop**, which set the stage with engaging discussions on the human factors of security and usable privacy. I enjoyed connecting with researchers who share my passion for bridging the gap between people and technology in security systems.

### Reflections  
Now that NDSS 2025 has wrapped up, I am reflecting on a truly inspiring experience:  
- Insightful talks on cutting-edge research in security and privacy.  
- Conversations with brilliant experts whose work I had long admired from Egypt.  
- The chance to finally meet and learn from leaders in our field face-to-face.  

It was surreal to connect with people whose papers once shaped my own studies, and to now stand alongside them as a PhD student pursuing similar questions.

### Gratitude  
I am grateful for every connection and conversation from this week. Beyond the technical sessions, San Diego‚Äôs **sunshine and ocean views** added the perfect backdrop for building new collaborations and friendships.  

Looking forward to building on what I‚Äôve learned and continuing these conversations as my research in **human-centered security and privacy** evolves.
