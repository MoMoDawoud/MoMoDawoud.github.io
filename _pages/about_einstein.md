Hi, Iâ€™m **Mohamed Moustafa Dawoud** ðŸ‘‹  

Iâ€™m a PhD student in **Computer Science & Engineering** at the [University of California, Santa Cruz](https://engineering.ucsc.edu/departments/computer-science-and-engineering/), where I work with [Prof. Ramakrishnan (Ram) Sundara Raman](https://ramakrishnansr.com). I research **human-centered security and privacy** at the intersection of technology, policy, and human experience. My work examines how digital systems, privacy laws, and emerging AI threats such as deepfakes and disinformation shape â€” and often undermine â€” trust, freedom, and dignity. Using **large-scale audits, experiments, surveys, and interviews**, I study how people understand digital protections, how experts and policymakers interpret vague or conflicting regulations, and where compliance gives way to exploitation. From these insights, I design and evaluate systems that expose violations, resist censorship and surveillance, and make protections more usable and transparent across contexts and borders. My goal is not incremental fixes but **evidence-based redesigns** that reimagine technology and policy as forces that empower people and strengthen democratic values.  

Before UCSC, I studied **Computer Science (Information Security)** at the German International University in Cairo on a full merit scholarship, and I later worked at **Dartmouth College**, where I explored how humans perceive and interact with cybersecurity systems. Along the way, Iâ€™ve contributed to projects on **deepfakes, privacy regulation (like CCPA), and usable security education**.  

I grew up in **Zefta, Egypt**, a city famous for its proud history of resilience and independence. That spirit continues to guide my academic journey â€” from scoring among the **top 20 students nationwide** in Egyptâ€™s high school system to presenting my work on Capitol Hill as part of the **AAAS CASE Workshop**.  

When Iâ€™m not deep in research, youâ€™ll probably find me in the gym ðŸ’ª, walking along the California coast ðŸŒŠ, or sharing thoughts on privacy and internet freedom on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mohamedmostafadawod/).  

âœ¨ **Big picture?** Iâ€™m driven by a simple goal: to help build a digital world where people feel safe, empowered, and understood.
